# TODO list

* add some simple test suite.
* add `git`'s commit hash as a define, that can be used inside OpenSCAD models, for reference.
* add support for default 'assembly' previews generation, so that whole model can be previewed easily, and image added to documentation
* update documentation to reflect all the recent changes, before releasing
