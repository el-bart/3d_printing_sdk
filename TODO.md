# TODO list

* allow defaults to be set on a per-file basis, so that single project can use multiple materials for different elements (eg. hull out of PET-G and custom seals from TPU).
* add some simple test suite.
* add `git`'s commit hash as a define, that can be used inside OpenSCAD models, for reference.
* add support for building each model with different material and patch (eg. in the smae model some things might need to be PET-G and waterproof, while other might be TPU and solid)
* add support for default 'assmbly' previews generation, so that whole model can be previewed easily, and image added to documentation
* enable 'arachne' slicing mode
* update documentation to reflect all the recent changes, before releasing
